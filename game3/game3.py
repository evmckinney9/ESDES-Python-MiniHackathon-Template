1. Replace this block comment with a useful description of what this file is

Make the game start by running this file.

2. Python Objectives:
    a. Implement advanced language features of Python (e.g. lambda functions, itertools, generators, maps, decorators, keyword arguments)
    b. Explore unit testing and different project structure options (setup.py, __init__.py, requirements.txt) 
    c. Experiement with more packages (pillow, requests, opencv, gensim, keras, tensorflow, pytorch, scipy, beautitfulsoup, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, textblob, mahotas)

3. Game Objectives:
    a. Code a complex player vs computer game of your choice
    b. You can program whatever you want here but should still be a game with a win condition, a rule-set, and a player making decisions
    c. Does not need to be turn based (eg Pacman)
    d. Computer decision-making involves sophisticated process or external knowledge (eg Chess or Akinator) 
    e. Computer can be imperfect decision-maker, create different levels of difficulty

Focus on learning something new and don't worry about making the game extremely complicated
